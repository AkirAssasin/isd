# CSI - Cations and Substances Identificator
Hey there, boy! The strong has gone to war, the dumb to transfer chemicals and the smart to govern the world. You are neither... So you have been recruited and trained as a CSI!

# What am I supposed to do, sir?
Some people just cannot understand simple instructions and label objects wrongly. Your job is to check the labels and make sure they are correct. Don't give too much work to the smart (they have nuclear-related problems of their own) or you will get fired!

Green button is correct and red is wrong. Just so you know...

# Yes sir!
