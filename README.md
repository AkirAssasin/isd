# CSI - Cations and Substances Identificator.
Welcome to a fictional border where chemical companies transfer their chemicals into your country. Check their passports and make sure it's correct! If it's correct, let them pass, but if they are wrong, alert your colleagues!

# Pick your side!
Protect the market of cations and prevent the fakes and pirated cations from being transferred! - Q. Ruby

or...

Let as many wrong passport holders in and be part of the Insurgency! - I. Hgby

Just don't try to do both and fail terribly.
